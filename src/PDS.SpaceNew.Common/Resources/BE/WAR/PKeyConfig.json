//Naming Convention Exception for WAR and CEG Sites Although the values for Exval_01 and Cf_value_01 differ,
//the naming convention used to identify these parameters within the application will remain unchanged.
//However, an exception will be made for the WAR and CEG sites,
//where the term "Line" will be replaced with "Parameter Facility" to maintain consistency and clarity.
